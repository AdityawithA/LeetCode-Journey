Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.


tr -s ' ' '\n' < words.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2, $1}'
